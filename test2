Here’s a clear summary of the whole idea you’ve built so far:

You’re designing a web-based tool that helps digitize and organize inventory data (like serial numbers) that are currently stored only on paper (“feuilles”). Since scanning or OCR is unreliable due to handwriting, your solution lets users manually input and manage the data in a structured, easy way.

Core concept:
It’s an internal web app to record which employee has which equipment, then export all that data to an Excel file for backup, reporting, or integration into another system.

💡 Main Features

1. Employee List

You can create a list of employees.

Each employee’s section can expand or collapse (only one open at a time to avoid a long scrolling page).

Inside each employee’s section, you can manage their assigned equipment.



2. Equipment Management

Each employee can have several equipment items: PC, ECRAN, CLAVIER SOURIS, CASQUE, PHONE, FIX, SIM.

Each equipment entry has a type, serial number, and received date.

When collapsed, the equipment shows only its type and the last 3 characters of the serial number.

Only one equipment entry can be expanded at a time within an employee.



3. Excel Export

At the top, there’s a Download Excel button with a small icon.

When clicked, it collects all the entered data (employee names + equipment info) and generates an .xlsx file instantly in the browser — no server required.

⚙️ Why It’s Useful

Removes dependency on handwritten sheets that are hard to read or scan.

Creates a clean, digital source of truth for equipment distribution.

Ensures every serial number and assignment is traceable and exportable.

Works offline (pure HTML + JS) — no need for backend setup.

Would you like me to summarize it visually too (like a small diagram showing the data flow from “User → Web App → Excel”)? That helps if you’re planning to present this as a project.
